## Overview
In this project, we outline our process of creating an effective and reasonably accurate model to predict sales prices for houses in and around Seattle, Washington. Using data from house sales in 2014 and 2015 from a total of 70 different zip codes, we were able to design and train several models with acceptable accuracies given their complexity and inherent limitations. Specifically, we saught to use multiple linear regression models via the `statsmodels` and `sklearn` libraries in Python, and we briefly explored the Gradient Boost Regressor to understand how it could be used to improve the quality of future analyses.
